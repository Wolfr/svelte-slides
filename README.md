## Svelte presentation

My basic setup for browser based presentation using Svelte.

### Credits

This codebase was started based on <a href="https://github.com/pngwn/bristech-2019">pngwn's work for Bristech 2019 presentation</a>. I started modifying this to my needs.

Here are some of his notes:

> They are designed only for desktop and are really designed to work woth Chrome's full-screen mode (ctrl+cmd+f on a mac) although this only matters for one or two slides.

> You can move forward by pressing the right arrow key, you can't step backwards through the animations but you can navigate back in the borwser to go to a previous 'screen'.
